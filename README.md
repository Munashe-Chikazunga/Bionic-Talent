# Bionic Talent Assessment

## Project Overview
This project is a responsive web page design created as part of an interview assessment. The goal was to implement a pixel-perfect HTML and CSS webpage based on the provided design files, adhering to specific requirements and best practices for responsive, cross-browser development.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage adapts smoothly to various screen sizes, including mobile devices (320px width) and larger desktop screens.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Tested and functional on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **Semantic HTML5**: The structure uses semantic tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<main>` for clarity and SEO benefits.
